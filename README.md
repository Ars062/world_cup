BeautifulSoup – For web scraping.

Pandas – For handling and transforming tabular data.

Matplotlib / Seaborn – For data visualization.

Jupyter Notebook – Interactive development environment.

🔍 Project Workflow
Web Scraping

Used requests and BeautifulSoup to scrape player statistics from the OEB (assumed to be a stats site).

Extracted tables containing batting information for World Cup matches.

Data Processing

Cleaned and transformed the data into a structured DataFrame.

Saved the cleaned data into batting.csv.

Data Analysis

Performed statistical analysis on players' performances.

Analyzed metrics such as average, strike rate, number of innings, high scores, etc.

Filtered and visualized top performers in various categories.

Visualization

Used visual plots (bar charts, pie charts, etc.) to highlight player performance insights.

📈 Key Insights
Identified top run scorers in various ICC World Cup editions.

Compared player performances across different countries.

Derived meaningful insights through aggregation and visualization.
